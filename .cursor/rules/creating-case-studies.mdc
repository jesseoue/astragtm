# How to Create a Case Study

Follow these steps to add a new case study to the website.

1.  **Create a New Page File**:
    *   Navigate to the `[app/case-studies/](mdc:app/case-studies)` directory.
    *   Create a new sub-directory for the company (e.g., `slack`).
    *   Inside that new directory, create a `page.tsx` file. For example: `[app/case-studies/slack/page.tsx](mdc:app/case-studies/stripe/page.tsx)`.

2.  **Use the `CaseStudyLayout` Component**:
    *   The primary component for structuring a case study is `[CaseStudyLayout](mdc:components/case-studies/case-study-layout.tsx)`.
    *   Import it and use it as the main wrapper in your new `page.tsx` file.
    *   Pass the required props: `companyName`, `companyLogoUrl`, `title`, `description`, `stats`, and `imageUrl`.

3.  **Write the Content**:
    *   The main narrative of the case study should be added as `children` to the `CaseStudyLayout` component.
    *   Use standard JSX/HTML tags (`<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<blockquote>`, etc.) for the content. The layout component already includes styling for these elements via `prose`.

4.  **Add to the Index Page**:
    *   Open the main case studies index page: `[app/case-studies/page.tsx](mdc:app/case-studies/page.tsx)`.
    *   Add a new entry to the `caseStudies` array at the top of the file. Make sure the `slug` matches the directory name you created in step 1.

### Example

For a blueprint, refer to the existing Stripe case study: `[app/case-studies/stripe/page.tsx](mdc:app/case-studies/stripe/page.tsx)`.
